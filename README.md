# Firebase Studio

This is a Next.js starter project in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

This app is built with Next.js, React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, and Genkit. It's a great starting point for your projects!

The project is now ready to be versioned with Git.
